> He's **nervous about** the presentation.

### 2. Adjectives ending in '-ed' and '-ing'

+ '-ing' mean that describing objective let people feel



### 3-4. Articles: 'a', 'an', 'the'

`mistake`

1. Is there **a** university where you live?
2. I can take the children to school today.
3. She was born in Japan, but she went to  university in the Bahamas. Because she was a student.

#### Jobs

When we say what people's jobs are, we usually use *a*/*an*.

> *He's **an** architect.
> She's **a** scientist.
> My grandmother was **a** teacher.*

#### Common phrases

We don't usually use an article in expressions with *bed*, *work* and *home*.

> *go to bed / be in bed
> go to work / be at work / start work / finish work
> go home / be at home / get home / stay at home*

We also don't normally use an article in expressions with *school*, *university*, *prison* and *hospital*.

> *start school / go to school / be at school
> go to university / be at university
> be sent to prison / go to prison / be in prison
> go to hospital / be in hospital*

But we usually use *the* if someone is just visiting the place, and not there as a student/prisoner/patient, etc.

> *My son has started **school** now. I went to **the school** to meet his teacher.
> I went to **the prison** a lot when I was a social worker.
> I'm at **the hospital**. My sister has just had a baby.*

#### Place names

We don't normally use an article for continents, most countries, cities, towns, lakes, mountains or universities. So, we say:

> *Africa, Asia, Europe
> India, Ghana, Peru, Denmark
> Addis Ababa, Hanoi, New York, Moscow
> Lake Victoria, Lake Superior, Lake Tanganyika
> Mount Everest, Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Elbrus
> Cardiff University, Harvard University, Manchester University*

Some countries are different. Country names with *United* have *the*. There are other countries which are exceptions too. So, we say:

> *the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States of America
> the Bahamas, the Gambia*

Seas and oceans, mountain ranges and rivers have *the*:

> *the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Mediterranean
> the Andes, the Himalayas, the Alps
> the Nile, the Amazon, the Yangtze*

Universities with *of* in the title also have *the*:

> *the University of Cape Town, the University of Delhi, the University of Tokyo*



### 5. Comparative adjectives

::: note mistake

1. I like to go to work early because the bus is **more crowded** after 8.

:::

Exception: You can either add *-er*/*-r* or use *more* with some two-syllable adjectives, such as *common*, *cruel*, *gentle*, *handsome*, *likely*, *narrow*, *pleasant*, *polite*, *simple* and *stupid*.

> *I think life in the countryside is* ***simpler\*** *than in the city.*
> *It's* ***more simple\*** *to live in the city because everything you need is there.*



### 6. Infinitive of purpose

::: note mistake

1. He needs a new computer **to edit** video.

:::



### 7. countable and uncountable

::: note mistake

1. We have **a  lot of** chairs but we don't have **any** tables.
2. There isn't **any** toothpaste.
3. I bought **some** new shoes
4. We've got **some** chicken.
5. How **many** people
6. Do you want **some/any** chocolate

:::

 uncountable nouns:  **furniture advice** **luggage bread**



#### question

In questions we use *a*/*an*, *any* or *how many* with **countable** nouns.

> *Is there **an** email address to write to?
> Are there **any** chairs?
> **How many** chairs are there?*

And we use *any* or *how much* with **uncountable** nouns.

> *Is there **any** sugar?
> **How much** orange juice is there?*

But when we are **offering** something or **asking** for something, we normally use *some*.

> *Do you want **some** chocolate?
> Can we have **some** more chairs, please?*

We also use *some* in a question when we think the answer will be '**yes**'.

> *Have you got **some** new glasses?*

#### Other expressions of quantity

*A lot of* (or *lots of*) can be used with both countable and uncountable nouns.

> *There are **lots of** apples on the trees.
> There is **a lot of** snow on the road*.

Notice that we don't usually use *many* or *much* in **positive** sentences. We use *a lot of* instead.

> *They have **a lot of** money.*

However, in **negative** sentences we use *not many* with countable nouns and *not much* with uncountable nouns.

> *There are a lot of carrots but there are**n't many** potatoes.
> There's lots of juice but there is**n't much** water.*



### 8. Past continuous and past simple

::: note mistake

1. I **started** my new job yesterday.
2. They **were already closing** the shop when I got there, so I couldn't go in and buy anything.
3. This time last year I **was studying** at university.
4. At 6 p.m. yesterday it **was already getting** dark.
5. I saw you driving down Green Street yesterday! Where **were you going** ?
6. When we saw the crime, we called the police.

:::



#### past continuous

The past continuous shows us that the action **was already** in progress at a certain time in the past.

> *What were you doing at 8 p.m. last night? I was studying.*

This means that I started studying b**efore 8 p.m. and I continued** after 8 p.m.

The past continuous can also show that an activity was in **progress for some time**, not just for a moment.

> *We were cleaning the house all morning.*

We make the past continuous with *was* or *were* and the -*ing* form of the verb.

> *She couldn't come to the party. She was working.
> Three years ago, we were living in my home town.
> I tried to give him some advice, but he wasn't listening.
> What were you doing this time last year?*



#### Past continuous and past simple

+ The past simple shows us that an action was in the past, not in the present.

+ The past continuous shows us that the action was already in progress at a certain time in the past.

When we use these two tenses together, it shows us that the **past simple** action happened **in the middle of** the past continuous action, while it was in progress.

> *While I was studying, I suddenly felt sleepy.*

We often use these tenses to show an action **interrupting another action.**

> *I broke my leg when I was skiing.
> As I was going to work, I saw an old friend.
> We were watching television when the power went off.*

Can you see a difference in the meaning of these two sentences?

> *When the guests arrived, Jane was cooking dinner.
> When the guests arrived, Jane cooked dinner.*

In the first one, Jane started cooking dinner before the guests arrived. We know that because it uses the past continuous. In the second sentence, the guests arrived first **and then** Jane started cooking.



### 9. Possessive 's

::: note mistake

1. Sara's **parents'** house is in Sydney. They live near the beach.

:::

We often use possessive *'s* or *s'* when we talk about family and friends.

> *Grandma and Grandpa are my mum**'s** parents.
> Maria**'s** best friend is Juanita.
> My cousin**s'** birthdays are both in January.*

It is possible to use more than one possessive in a phrase.

> *We had lunch at my friend**'s** father'**s** house.*

If a name or noun ends in *s*, we can add either *'* or *'s*. The pronunciation can be */zɪz/* or */sɪz/*.

> *Is that James**'** bag?
> That's my boss**'s** office.*

If the thing belongs to **more than one person**, we usually add *'* after the *s* of the plural noun.

> *Our friend**s'** house is in the mountains. They moved there last year.
> My grandparent**s'** dog is called Bertie.
> The twin**s'** school is closed today.*

If the plural noun is irregular and doesn't end in *s*, we add *'s*.

> *This is our children**'s** school.
> The women**'s** clothes are on the second floor.
> A lot of people**'s** eyes are brown.*

If something belongs to more than one person, and we give a list of names, the *'s* comes after the last name in the list.

> *Liam is Anne and Gary**'s** son.*
